### The Problem: Early Music Education

#### Traditional music education is often: 

1. **Boring** to practice and learn. 
    - 50% of students quit their instrument after 1-2 years and this trend is on the rise.
    - In today’s world of social media and video games, it is incredibly difficult to compete for attention. 
2. **Ineffective** at inspiring musical creativity. 
    - Music students are simply translating someone else's musical expression.
    - After years of education, many students still don't know how to write music. 
3. **Misguided** in its focus on notation and the “grammar” of music.
    - Current music education pedagogy relies heavily on sight reading, annotation, and mathematical intelligence, rather than creativity.

### The Solution: Build the education process around the aspects of music that make it so powerful, focusing on:

1. A **gratifying** song-writing experience 
    - Studies show that young children have incredible language acquisition skills which can be extended to developing musical literacy.
    - Even without experience, we want songwriting to be accessible to anyone.
2. A **simple interface** that grows in complexity as the student develops
    - A piano has 88 keys, a guitar has 126 notes, and DAWs like Logic and Ableton have a plethora of knobs and buttons, all requiring a professional teacher or days spent on YouTube to acquire even a baseline of proficiency. 
    - By breaking down the musical education and creation process into digestible nodes, GrooveBlocks will be far more approachable. 
    - This gives structure to learn and freedom to create, keeping the student in the happy medium between being bored and overwhelmed, where they are able to grow. 
3. An **adaptive learning environment** that follows what the student engages with and builds around it 
    - Rather than prescribing a viola or trombone, we offer the student a platter of musical expression where they are able to discover who they are as a musician. If they enjoy Rap,         they can learn  sampling, 808s, and percussion; if they like EDM, they can learn about vocal chops, super saws, and sidechaining.

### Our Product: GrooveBlocks 
Modular musical building blocks that interface with a digital application to integrate elements of music production with tactile, visceral components. 

#### HARDWARE:

1. Combinatory, building blocks to capture rhythm, melody, harmony, and effects.
   - Keyboard block
   - Chord block
   - Percussion blocks (2-3)
   - Vocal block
   - Effects blocks (reverb, delay, etc.)
2. Blocks can be connected to discover new musical pathways (i.e. mic to keys for sampling)


#### SOFTWARE: 

Our Application has learn, jam, and create modes, but builds a loose barrier between them, making it seamless to go from learning to jamming to writing. This way the student will learn quickly and at their own pace.

1. **Learn**: starts you on the AI teacher path with suggestive learning 
    - Follows what you engage with and enjoy and builds around that 
    - If you are stuck or bored with an area, it lets you explore a new one.
    - Introduces new material when you are ready and interested. 
2. **Jam**: designed to teach improvisation
    - Our musician consultants have stressed how important improvisation is to growth and how enjoyable it can be.
    - Students can choose song reference or rhythm/chord progression and jam away 
    - Helps students learn how to play and collaborate with other people (parent/student, teacher/student, peer/peer)
3. **Write**: gratifying, exciting song-writing experience
    - Varying levels of assistance based on where the student is at
    - Initially give lots of structure (loops/simple drum patterns/easy chord progressions), then give the student more freedom as they become more experienced
    - Suggestions/guidance is informed by students' past decisions and their style
    - Strong focus on collaboration; very easy to create/share pieces with your friends or teachers.
