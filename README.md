### The Problem: Early Music Education

#### Traditional music education is often: 

1. \textbf{Boring} to practice and learn. 
    50% of students quit their instrument after 1-2 years and this trend is on the rise. In today’s world of social media and video games, it is incredibly difficult to compete for attention. 
2. Ineffective at inspiring musical creativity. 
    Music students are simply translating someone else's musical expression.
    After years of education, many students still don’t have the ability to create their own music. 
3. Misguided in its focus on notation and the “grammar” of music.
Currently, children’s introduction to music heavily involves sight reading and notation, learning music through linguistic and mathematical intelligence, rather than developing their own musical voice.

### The Solution: Build the education process around the aspects of music that make it so powerful, focusing on:
1. A gratifying song-writing experience 
    Studies show that young children have incredible language acquisition skills which can be extended to developing musical literacy. Even without experience, we want song writing to be accessible to anyone.
2. A simple interface that grows in complexity as the student develops
    A piano has 88 keys, a guitar has 126 notes, DAWs like Logic and Ableton have a plethora of knobs and buttons, all requiring a professional teacher or days spent on YouTube to acquire even a baseline of proficiency. 
    By breaking down the musical education and creation process into digestible nodes, GrooveBlocks will be far more approachable. 
    This gives structure to learn and freedom to create, keeping the student in the happy medium between being bored and overwhelmed, where they are able to grow. 
3. An adaptive learning environment that follows what the student engages with and builds around it 
    Rather than prescribing a viola or trombone, offer the student a platter of musical expression where they are able to discover who they are as a musician. 
    If they enjoy Rap, teach them sampling, 808s, percussion, if they like EDM, teach them vocal chops, super saws, sidechaining. 
    This helps the student find their own version of musical expression

### Our Product: GrooveBlocks 
Modular musical building blocks that interface with a digital application to integrate elements of music production with tactile, visceral components. 

#### HARDWARE:

1. Sleek, muted tones as base 
2. Vibrant colors from Neopixel lights bring it to life
3. Blocks to capture rhythm, melody, harmony and effects 
4. Blocks can be connected to discover new musical pathways (i.e. mic to keys for sampling)


#### SOFTWARE: 

Our Application has learn, jam and create modes, but build a loose barrier between them, making it seamless to go from learning, to jamming, to writing and producing. This way the student will learn quicker and at their own pace, and are encouraged to find their own musical voice. 

#### Learn, Jam, Write
1. Learn: starts you on the AI teacher path with suggestive learning 
    Follows what you engage with and enjoy and builds around that 
    If you are stuck or bored with an area, it lets you explore a new one.
    Introduces new material when you are ready and interested. 
2. Jam: designed to teach improvisation
    Our musician consultants have stressed how important improvisation is to growing and how enjoyable it can be.
    Choose song reference or rhythm/chord progression and jam away 
    Learn how to play and collaborate with other people 
    Parent/student, teacher/student, peer/peer
3. Write: gratifying, exciting song-writing experience with a strong focus on the human voice to develop the students musical expression.
    Varying levels of assistance based on where the student is at
    Initially give lots of structure, focusing on loops, simple drum patterns and easy chord progressions, but control of certain parameters and timbre/rhythm 
    As the user gets more experienced, take the training wheels off and give them more freedom, but suggestions when they get stuck/frustrated 
    Suggestions are based on AI that is informed by their past interests/decisions and typical ways they could keep building on the song
    This can be an easy way of collaboration, creating and sharing pieces with your friends or teachers.
